  I'm a Ruby developer with five years of expertise, I am able to write clean
  Ruby On Rails applications from scratch to deploy. This is my passion and I’m
  completely committed to fulfill all needs to achieve client satisfaction no
  matter what. When I’m not writing code alone or with an awesome distributed
  team, I enjoy walking my dog Dasha, hit the gym, spend time with my family
  and hang out with friends. I am here to help you code the next big thing!
